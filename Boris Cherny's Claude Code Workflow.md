🚨𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: The guy who BUILT Claude Code just revealed his actual workflow.

While most people “try AI”…

Boris Cherny runs 10–15 Claude sessions in parallel.

5 in his terminal.
5–10 in the browser.
All shipping code at the same time.

And the real weapon?

CLAUDE.md

A living instruction file that evolves every time Claude makes a mistake.

His rule is brutal:

> “After every correction, update CLAUDE.md so you never make that mistake again.”

So Claude literally writes rules for itself.

The longer you use it →
The smarter it gets on your codebase →
The fewer mistakes it repeats.

This isn’t prompting.

This is orchestration.

His framework includes:

• Plan mode for any non-trivial task
• Subagents for parallel research & execution
• Verification before marking anything “done”
• Autonomous bug fixing (no hand-holding)
• A self-improvement loop after every correction

One more insane detail:

He hasn’t written SQL in 6+ months.

Claude pulls BigQuery data directly via CLI.

Claude Code now drives ~4% of all public GitHub commits.

Let that sink in.

Most devs are still chatting with AI.

Power users are building fleets of autonomous engineers.

The difference?

One markdown file.

CLAUDE.md isn’t a prompt.

It’s infrastructure.

Drop it into any serious project.

Or get outpaced.
